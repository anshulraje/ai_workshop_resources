## RRT
RRT is a random sampling based path planning algorithm. The code to implement this algorithm can be found in the RRT folder above. But please make sure you have the pygame library installed! If you don't have pygame installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```
$ sudo apt get
$ sudo apt install python3-pip
$ pip install pygame
```
Happy learning!
